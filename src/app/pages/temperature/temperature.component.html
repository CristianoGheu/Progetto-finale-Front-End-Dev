    <p>The current global warming rate is not natural. From 1880 to 1981 was (0.07°C / 0.13°F) per decade. Since 1981 this rate has increased to (0.18°C / 0.32°F) Climate Change: Global Temperature.</p>

    <p>Some of the past sudden increase on global temperature present in this graph, correspond to the Roman Warm Period and the Medieval Warm Period. These events were at regional and not global scale.</p>

    <p class="highlight">Key takeaway: The total average global temperature rise since the industrial revolution is around (1.0 °C / 1.8 °F).</p>
    
    <p>Earth northern hemisphere is warming faster. The arctic has warmed between (2 °C / 3.6 °F) and (4 °C / 7.2 °F).</p>

    <p>Earth temperature and the proportion of gases such as Co2, methane, and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere is strictly correlated.</p>
